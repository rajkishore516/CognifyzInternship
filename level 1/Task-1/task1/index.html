            Vibrant isn’t a precise colour term as people will use it differently, but generally it’s used to describe bright, intense colour. In better colour terminology, vibrant = high-chroma or saturated colour.

            Mixing colour with a brush or a knife gives the same result, although it’s a heck of a lot faster with a knife! I personally don’t think properly-mixed colour is dull at all, although I know some people like part-mixed colour so you can see ripples or marbles in the mix this isn’t better or worse, just different.
